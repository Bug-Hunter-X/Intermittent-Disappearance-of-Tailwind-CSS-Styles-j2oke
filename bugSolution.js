```javascript
// ... some Tailwind CSS classes ...
<div class="bg-gray-200 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Resolved Bug</h2>
  <p>This is some text with a <span class="text-red-500 !important">red</span> highlight that now persists consistently.</p>
</div>

/* Solutions attempted:
1.  !important: Adding !important to the problematic CSS class(es) forces the styles to override any conflicts. 
2.  Specificity: Investigate and adjust CSS specificity to ensure the intended styles take precedence.
3.  CSS Order: Check the order of your CSS declarations to ensure that conflicting selectors do not unintentionally override the desired styles.
4.  Purge Unused Styles: Run `npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch` to ensure only used styles are included. This may help to identify and address conflicts.
