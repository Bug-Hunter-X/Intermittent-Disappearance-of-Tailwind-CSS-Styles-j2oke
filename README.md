# Intermittent Disappearance of Tailwind CSS Styles

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered with Tailwind CSS where styles applied to certain elements intermittently disappear. The issue is not consistently reproducible, making it particularly challenging to debug.  The bug seems related to the interaction of multiple classes, specificity, or possible order-of-operations issues within the CSS.

The `bug.js` file contains the example code demonstrating the bug. The `bugSolution.js` file contains a potential solution(s), explained in the file itself.
